## Abstract

By January of 2018, the overall global value of cryptoassets has reached to $800 billion.

In addition to cryptocurrency exchange, cryptotokens mortgage loan is another best way to get liquidity for cryptoassets holders.

However, as different platforms of cryptoasset loan are based on different rules,rare liquidity among cryptoassets loan services exists, user experience improvement is in urgent need.

Based on Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain platform, The Force Protocol team will develop
cryptocurrency loan protocols and standards in different scenarios.

By converting cryptocurrency borrowing request into tokens exchange-like trading, order format standardization is realized.

Stablecoins can cooperate with loan services. To make full use of stablecoins, Dual Token Model is proposed here, which can overcome shortcomings of existing stablecoins economic models.

With this model, policy risk can be removed by introduction of supervision from third party custodian bank and auditing institution.

In addition, sustainable full currency reserve mechanism is proposed for the first time.

The Force Protocol will open source, and its instructions are encouraged to be called through API by third-party applications (supernode), with the purpose of providing protocol layer services for different cryptocurrency loan applications around the world.

Moreover, liquidity and depth of loan platform are also expanded.

## 引言

截止2018年1月，全球加密数字资产价值总额最高已达8000亿美金。除加密数字资产交
换外，在以太坊体系上的一系列加密数字金融服务已成为加密数字资产持有人获得的金
融服务的新选择。然而，由于不同加密数字资产金融服务应用平台基于不同的规则，使得
加密数字资产金融服务应用间缺乏互动，协同开发难度大，用户使用体验较差。
原力协议是分布式加密数字金融服务协议，基于主流公链系统和底层跨链协议，通过对分
布式金融业务流程的抽象和封装，以SDK及API的形式，用一站式解决方案赋能去中心化
金融应用开发。为跨平台资产流转、交易深度共享、跨链加密资产抵押的稳定币发行、通
证债券发行、链上支付、交易清结算等金融需求提供解决方案。原力协议在分布式金融生

求框架化、系统化，为分布式网络内的金融服务提供通信标准和开发框架，让加密资产可
以在统一的框架内实现安全高效的价值互联互通。
